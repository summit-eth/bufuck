You can buy more printers to increase your banknotes printing production rate. <li> You can collect your BUSD anytime from your vault directly into your wallet and your printers will continue printing banknotes filling your vault again. </ol> <p> Printers will continue printing banknotes filling your vault with BUSD non stop. You can "buy more printers" or pocket your BUSD at any time. </p> <h2>Yield mining</h2> <p> Our algorithm allows every user to profit handsomely, no matter their mining strategy. It will not allow any single user to have an unfair advantage over other users. </p> <h2>Yield mining returns</h2> <p> BUSD FACTORY gives users atleast 10% daily return, according to the current mining efficiency rate. The mining efficiency rate rises and falls as you and other users buy printers, compound earnings and pocket BUSD rewards. </p> <h2>Yield mining Tips</h2> <p> The best strategy for increasing your earnings is to buy more printers sooner and more often than other users. This in turn rewards you with more BUSD at a faster rate. </p> <p> Buying more printers every day using your BUSD earnings will 10x the number of printers you have within 30 days or less </p> <h2>Contract Details</h2> <p> The contract is open source and visible on BscScan. It is rug free and immutable, meaning there are no functions that the dev can use to drain or change its operations. </p> <p> The probability of the BUSD miner contract balance becoming zero is highly unlikely due to our 10% maximum daily return and considering that many users are regularly compounding their daily returns for larger future profits. </p> <h2>Referrals</h2> <p> Earn 10% of the BUSD used to buy printers by anyone who starts mining using your referral link. You will receive 10% of every deposit they do. </p> <h2>Fees</h2> <p> The only fee that users personally incur is their transaction gas fees. 8% development fee is paid to the developer but this fee is not paid by you as a user, this fee is paid to the developer by the contract as a whole. </p> <h2>Yield mining strategies</h2> <p> While the BUSD miner algorithm makes sure that all users receive their fair share of rewards, it also favours its most supportive users through its compounding programme. Compounding can be done by collecting your printed BUSD and buying more printers. </p> <p> Strategies are personal, you either "buy more printers" every day, "collect BUSD" every day, or you do a healthy combination of both. In our opinion the best strategy is to compound on daily basis. Once you're happy with your daily, weekly or monthly results, take profits as often as you see fit and simply continue compounding the rest. </p> <p> Keep in mind that the 10% return is not constant, it will vary slightly based on a combination of factors, including your personal buying, pocketing, compounding habits and the habits of the community as a whole. Your personal habits hold much more weight in regards to your overal personal returns. Also remember, just as that number can decrease it also increases based on a combination of those same habits. </p> <p> After buying any number of printers, you will begin to see returns very close to the advertised 10% daily, this number will rise and fall based on the factors explained above. We will not attempt to share any exact numbers because the maths behind the contract is complicated. You can see the results in the earnings you receive for yourself. </p> <p> BUSDFACTORY is complete and 100% automated DeFi.
